# Evaluation and Comparison of Methods of Quantifying Explainability in Machine Learning Models

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Evaluation and Comparison of Methods of Quantifying Explainability in Machine Learning Models" project. In this project, we delve into the realm of model explainability and its importance in understanding the inner workings of complex machine learning models. Our goal is to explore and quantify explainability using LIME and SHAP explainers, focusing on enhancing interpretability for black box models.

## Data

We utilize a diverse dataset containing a wide range of features to train our black box models. The dataset includes [describe your dataset details here].

## Steps

Our project unfolds through the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare and clean the dataset for model training and explainability analysis.

2. **Model Selection:** Choose black box models such as Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and XGBoost for evaluation.

3. **Explainability Quantification:** Employ LIME and SHAP explainers to quantify the explainability of model predictions.

4. **Interpretability Enhancement:** Analyze the insights provided by explainers to enhance the interpretability of black box models.
